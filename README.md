# Grant Royseth's Quiz #

I started by making an index html and a javascript file.
I made some javascript questions in an array.
Then I made it possible to cycle the questions.
I made a timer function for the questions, along with a display for the timer.
I then made a check answer function and made a scoring system.
once you answer the questions or the timer is "0", then a promt will appear for you to enter your intials.
I made another file called "score.html" for the score stats.
The score and intials are saved and displayed on the score board page.
I made another javascript file ("js.js") to keep track of the scoreboard funtions.
It will display your current stats and there is a submit button.
Finally once you click the back button it brings you back to the quiz page.
